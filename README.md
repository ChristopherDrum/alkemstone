# Hunt for the Alkemstone
_Foolishly trying to solve a decades-old, terribly-designed treasure hunt_.

Thanks to [Jason Dyer](https://twitter.com/jdyer)'s excellent blog [Renga in Blue](https://bluerenga.blog/), we now know of the unsolved real-world treasure hunt [Alkemstone](https://bluerenga.blog/tag/alkemstone/?order=ASC) by long-defunct game developer [Level 10](https://www.mobygames.com/company/level-10).

In this obscure game for the Apple \]\[ home computer, the "player" is presented with a maze to explore.  On the walls, ceiling, and floor of the maze are written clues to the location of a "treasure" buried by the developers in the real world.  It was meant to be found by a player, dug up, and presented back to the developer for a reward of $5000.  But the game flopped, and nobody ever found (or perhaps even looked for) the treasure.

Which means __the treasure is still out there, waiting to be found__.

# About this repository

Those of us who can't let an unsolved puzzle lie have decided to try to find the treasure before it is lost forever.  This repository is an attempt to gather all of the clues and the current going theories into one place for easy tracking.

If you'd like to help solve the mystery, the best place to start is by [reading Jason's first blog post describing the game](https://bluerenga.blog/2020/02/05/alkemstone-1980/).  From there, it should be fairly clear what the contents of the repository mean.

If you have ideas about the clues and you don't see them reflected in the repository, __please submit a pull request__ and we will add them!

Thanks for hunting,
\- Casey
